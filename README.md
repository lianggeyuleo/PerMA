# PerMA
Code for Personalized Dictionary Learning

This project contains the code for https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15311, specifically the meta-algorithm PerMA introduced therein. There are in total three numerical experiments, which can be implemented respectively:

1. For the synthetic dataset experiment, run indi_vs_collab.m. To draw the plot, run indi_vs_collab_draw.m.
2. For the mnist dataset experiment, one can visit https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ for the data and convert it into .mat format. Run mnist_test.m to test the algorithm and indi_vs_collab_draw.m to draw the plot.
3. For the surveillance video experiment, one can visit http://backgroundmodelschallenge.eu/#learning for the data. Run perDL_car1_color.m to test the algorithm and perDL_car1_color_draw.m to draw the plot.
